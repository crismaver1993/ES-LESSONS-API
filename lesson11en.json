What important spiritual principles can we take from this story for ourselves, whatever struggles we are facing?</strong></p><p><strong>2 Chronicles 20:1–22</strong></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> It happened after this that the people of Moab with the people of Ammon, and others with them besides the Ammonites, came to battle against Jehoshaphat.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> Then some came and told Jehoshaphat, saying, “A great multitude is coming against you from beyond the sea, from Syria; and they are in Hazazon Tamar” (which is En Gedi).&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the Lord, and proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> So Judah gathered together to ask help from the Lord; and from all the cities of Judah they came to seek the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Then Jehoshaphat stood in the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem, in the house of the Lord, before the new court,&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>6</strong></sup> and said: “O Lord God of our fathers, are You not God in heaven, and do You not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, and in Your hand is there not power and might, so that no one is able to withstand You?&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> Are You not our God, who drove out the inhabitants of this land before Your people Israel, and gave it to the descendants of Abraham Your friend forever?&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> And they dwell in it, and have built You a sanctuary in it for Your name, saying,&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> ‘If disaster comes upon us—sword, judgment, pestilence, or famine—we will stand before this temple and in Your presence (for Your name is in this temple), and cry out to You in our affliction, and You will hear and save.’&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> And now, here are the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir—whom You would not let Israel invade when they came out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them and did not destroy them—&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> here they are, rewarding us by coming to throw us out of Your possession which You have given us to inherit.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> O our God, will You not judge them? For we have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> Now all Judah, with their little ones, their wives, and their children, stood before the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, in the midst of the assembly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> And he said, “Listen, all you of Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem, and you, King Jehoshaphat! Thus says the Lord to you: ‘Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>16</sup></strong> Tomorrow go down against them. They will surely come up by the Ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the brook before the Wilderness of Jeruel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>17</sup></strong> You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, who is with you, O Judah and Jerusalem!’ Do not fear or be dismayed; tomorrow go out against them, for the Lord is with you.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>18</sup></strong> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem bowed before the Lord, worshiping the Lord.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>19</sup></strong> Then the Levites of the children of the Kohathites and of the children of the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel with voices loud and high.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>20</sup></strong> So they rose early in the morning and went out into the Wilderness of Tekoa; and as they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, “Hear me, O Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem: Believe in the Lord your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed those who should sing to the Lord, and who should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army and were saying:</p><p>“Praise the Lord, For His mercy endures forever.”</p><p><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> Now when they began to sing and to praise, the Lord set ambushes against the people of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against Judah; and they were defeated.&nbsp;</p><p>Toward the close of Jehoshaphat’s reign, Judah was invaded. Jehoshaphat was a man of courage and valor. For years he had been strengthening his armies and his fortified cities. He was well prepared to meet almost any enemy; yet in this crisis, he did not put his confidence in his own strength but in the power of God. He set himself to seek the Lord, and he proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.</p><p>The people all gathered together in the court of the temple, as Solomon had prayed that they would do if faced by danger. All the men of Judah stood before the Lord with their wives and children. They prayed that God would confuse their enemies and that His name might be glorified. Then the king prayed, “ ‘We have no power against this great multitude that is coming against us; nor do we know what to do, but our eyes are upon You’ ” (2 Chron. 20:12, NKJV).</p><p>After they committed themselves to God in this manner, the Spirit of the Lord came upon a man of God, who said, “ ‘Do not be afraid nor dismayed because of this great multitude, for the battle is not yours, but God’s. . . . You will not need to fight in this battle. Position yourselves, stand still and see the salvation of the LORD’ ” (2 Chron. 20:15–17, NKJV).</p><p>So, early the next morning, the king assembled the people, with the Levitical choir in the front to sing the praises of God. Then he admonished the people, “ ‘Believe in the LORD your God, and you shall be established; believe His prophets, and you shall prosper’ ” (2 Chron. 20:20, NKJV). Then the choir began to sing, and their enemies destroyed one another, and “none escaped” (2 Chron. 20:24). It took the men of Judah three days just to collect the spoils of the battle, and on the fourth day they returned to Jerusalem, singing as they went.</p><p>Of course, the God who delivered them is the same God whom we love and worship, and His power is just as great today as back then. The challenge, for us, is to trust in Him and His leading.</p><p><strong>Read 2 Chronicles 20:20. What special significance should this text have for Seventh-day Adventists?</strong></p>",

He should have known from the experience of his best friend, Jonathan, that when you are in covenant relationship with God, it doesn’t matter whether you have a few men or many; God can give you the victory. In 1 Samuel 14:1–23, the Bible records the story of how Saul’s son Jonathan and Jonathan’s armor-bearer defeated an entire garrison of Philistines—with the help of God. But in spite of this experience and many others in the history of God’s people, when difficult times came to King David, he allowed Satan to tempt him to trust in his own strength and ingenuity.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Read 1 Chronicles 21:1–14. Why did David decide to number Israel or count his soldiers? Why did his commander Joab counsel against this?</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1 Chronicles 21:1–14.</strong></p><p><sup><br></sup></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Now Satan stood up against Israel, and moved David to number Israel.</p><p><strong><sup>2</sup></strong> So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people, “Go, number Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring the number of them to me that I may know it.”</p><p><strong><sup>3</sup></strong> And Joab answered, “May the Lord make His people a hundred times more than they are. But, my lord the king, are they not all my lord’s servants? Why then does my lord require this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt in Israel?”</p><p><strong><sup>4</sup></strong> Nevertheless the king’s word prevailed against Joab. Therefore Joab departed and went throughout all Israel and came to Jerusalem.</p><p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> Then Joab gave the sum of the number of the people to David. All Israel had one million one hundred thousand men who drew the sword, and Judah had four hundred and seventy thousand men who drew the sword.</p><p>6 But he did not count Levi and Benjamin among them, for the king’s word was abominable to Joab.</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> And God was displeased with this thing; therefore He struck Israel.</p><p><strong><sup>8</sup></strong> So David said to God, “I have sinned greatly, because I have done this thing; but now, I pray, take away the iniquity of Your servant, for I have done very foolishly.”</p><p><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> Then the Lord spoke to Gad, David’s seer, saying,</p><p><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> “Go and tell David, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord: “I offer you three things; choose one of them for yourself, that I may do it to you.” ’ ”</p><p><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> So Gad came to David and said to him, “Thus says the Lord: ‘Choose for yourself,</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> either three years of famine, or three months to be defeated by your foes with the sword of your enemies overtaking you, or else for three days the sword of the Lord—the plague in the land, with the angel of the Lord destroying throughout all the territory of Israel.’ Now consider what answer I should take back to Him who sent me.”</p><p><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> And David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Please let me fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercies are very great; but do not let me fall into the hand of man.”</p><p><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> So the Lord sent a plague upon Israel, and seventy thousand men of Israel fell.</p><p><br></p><p>Note that it was Satan’s idea to count the soldiers. He tempted David to trust in his own strength rather than to depend on the providence of God in his defense. Joab, the leader of Israel’s army, tried to persuade David not to number Israel because he had seen God work on behalf of Israel, but David demanded that the numbering go forward. His actions brought calamity to the nation, as the text reveals.</p><p><br></p><p>No one ever trusted God in vain. Whenever you do battle for the Lord, prepare yourself. And prepare well too. There’s a quote, attributed to a British ruler, Oliver Cromwell (1599–1658), who, before a battle, said to his army, “Put your trust in God, my boys, and keep your powder dry!” (The powder was gunpowder.) In other words, do all that you can to succeed, but, in the end, realize that only God can give you victory.</p><p><br></p><p>In our immediate context, it is very tempting to trust in the power of the government or in our bank accounts, but in every crisis mentioned in the Bible, when the people trusted in God, He honored their trust and provided for them.</p><p><br></p><p>We should be using the present time to get square with God, get out of debt, and be generous with what we have been given. In the words of the well-known, Thomas Dorsey gospel song, “If we ever needed the Lord before, we sure do need Him now.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>How do we strike the right balance between doing what we can, for instance, to be financially secure, and yet, at the same time, trusting in the Lord for all things?</strong></p>",

Because we know that the end of the world and the second coming of Christ is near, we want to use our assets to tell others the good news of the gospel and what God has prepared for those who love Him. We understand that someday soon everything on this earth will be burned up.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Read 2 Peter 3:3–12.

For since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation.”</p><p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> For this they willfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water,</p><p><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> by which the world that then existed perished, being flooded with water.</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</p><p><sup>8</sup> But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</p><p><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance.</p><p><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.</p><p><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?</p><p><br></p><p>We understand from the Word of God that He is not sending moving vans to take our stuff to heaven. It will all get burned up in the final conflagration when all traces of sin and evil will be forever destroyed.</p><p><br></p><p>So, what should we do with our possessions? “It is now that our brethren should be cutting down their possessions instead of increasing them. We are about to move to a better country, even a heavenly. Then let us not be dwellers upon the earth, but be getting things into as compact a compass as possible.”—Ellen G. White, Counsels on Stewardship, p. 59.</p><p><br></p><p>Of course, she wrote those words more than a century ago! But still the principle remains: time is always short, because our lives are always short. What are 60, 80, or 100 years (if you have good genes and good health practices) in contrast to eternity? Your life can end before you finish reading this week’s lesson, and the next thing you will know is the second coming of Jesus. (Wow, that was fast after all, wasn’t it?)</p><p><br></p><p>As Seventh-day Adventist Christians we must always live in the light of eternity. Yes, of course, we need to work hard to provide for ourselves and our families; and if we have been blessed with wealth, nothing is wrong with enjoying it now, provided we don’t become greedy and are generous with it in regard to the needy. Yet, we must always remember that whatever we accumulate here is transitory; fleeting; and, if we are not careful, has the potential to be spiritually corrupting.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>If you knew Jesus were coming within ten years, how would you change your life?

How much of our lives today revolves around buying and selling? Our work is, in a sense, our selling of our time and skills and goods to those who want to buy them. Not being able to buy or sell all but means not being able to function in society. The pressure on those who remain faithful will then be enormous. Plus, the more money that you have, the more stake you will have in this world, at least in terms of material possessions, and so, surely, the pressure to conform will be even stronger.</p><p><br></p><p>How then do we prepare? We prepare now, by making sure through God’s grace that we are not slaves to our money, to the things of the world.

Why did God ask them to do this?</strong></p><p><sup><br></sup></p><p><strong><sup>22</sup></strong> “You shall truly tithe all the increase of your grain that the field produces year by year.</p><p><br></p><p>God explained through Moses that one of the reasons He established the tithing system was “ ‘that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always’ ” (Deut. 14:23, NKJV). In the poetic parallelism of Psalm 31:19, we see that fear is synonymous with trust. “Oh, how great is Your goodness, which You have laid up for those who fear You, which You have prepared for those who trust in You” (NKJV).</p><p><br></p><p>These parallel lines show us that to fear the Lord is to trust Him. Therefore, we understand that God established the tithing system to protect us from selfishness and to encourage us to trust Him to provide for us. While being faithful in tithe is certainly not a guarantee that people will stay faithful in the end, those who are not faithful in tithe are surely setting themselves up for trouble.</p>",

Though many members of our church don’t have these luxuries, many do—and they do so at the peril of their own souls. We are not talking about the “rich” now, as in millionaires and beyond.</p><p><br></p><p>They at least know that they’re rich, and they can heed (if they choose) the biblical cautions given them. We’re talking, instead, about many even of the middle-class people, who—amid smartphones, iMacs, air-conditioning, and SUVs—are fooled enough to think that because they are just “middle class,” they are not in danger of being spiritually pickled by their own prosperity. That’s why tithing can be, if nothing else, a powerful spiritual antidote to the dangers of wealth, even for those who are not particularly “wealthy.”</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Discussion Questions:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>1</strong>. Even if we are not rich by the world’s standards, why must we all be careful about our attitude toward money and wealth?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2</strong>. What are some practical things we can do, besides tithing, that can help us make sure we are not getting too caught up in the things of this world?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.</strong> What would happen to you tomorrow if, suddenly, you could not buy or sell because you are numbered among those “who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus” (Rev. 14:12, NKJV)? How well would your faith fare?</p>",

          "lessonText": "<p><strong>Two Best Friends</strong></p><p><strong>By CHIFUNDO KANJO</strong><br></p><p><br></p><p>Bahadu Ibrahim was born to non-Christian parents who expected him to follow their faith in central Malawi. He had no problem with that because he did not know any other religion.</p><p><br></p><p>But then an older brother married a Seventh-day Adventist woman and joined the Adventist Church. As a teen, Bahadu was sent by his parents to live with his brother and his wife in Malawi’s capital, Lilongwe. When Sabbath came, his brother expected him to go to church with them. Bahadu did not want to go, but he felt like he had no choice. For two years, he went to church every Sabbath out of a sense of duty.</p><p><br></p><p>Returning to his parents in Kaluluma village, he thought to forget the Bible. But he made friends with another teenager who happened to be an Adventist. Bahadu admired his new friend very much for his kindness and gentleness. Everyone in the village admired the young man and spoke highly of him.</p><p><br></p><p>One Sabbath, the friend invited Bahadu to go to church. What could Bahadu do? He went. He was glad to spend time with his best friend, even in church. As time passed, their friendship grew, and Bahadu listened to his friend explain that the seventh day was the true Sabbath of God. His friend gave him books to read. Little by little, he understood new truths about God and the Sabbath. However, he was not convinced tha. Saturday was the true Sabbath. Without his parents’ knowledge, he decided to compare the Bible with his family’s traditional religious book. As he read, he discovered that his family’s religious book contained only one woman’s name, Maryam, the mother of Jesus. He also discovered that Jesus is Lord. Bahadu decided to give his heart to Jesus in baptism. He no longer went to church out of sense of duty. He went to spend special time with his new best Friend.</p><p><br></p><p>After Bahadu’s baptism, his parents disowned him and stopped paying his high-school fees, leaving him unable to graduate with the rest of his class. Both of his parents died without accepting his decision, and many relatives continue to treat him with hostility today. But Bahadu has not wavered in his faith. “This is the best decision that I have ever made,” he said. Today he is a student at Malawi Adventist University, studying to become a pastor.</p><p><br></p><p>Thank you for your 2021 Thirteenth Sabbath Offering that is helping to construct a community outreach and leadership development center on the Mzuzu campus of Malawi Adventist University, where BAHADU studies, in the Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division. This quarter’s offering will support six additional educational projects in the neighboring East-Central Africa Division.</p>",
