          "lessonText": "<p>Several years ago, National Geographic magazine described a forest fire in Yellowstone National Park in the United States. After it ended, forest rangers trekked up a mountain to assess the damage. One ranger found a bird literally burned to ashes at the base of a tree. Somewhat sickened by the eerie sight, he knocked over the bird with a stick.<br><br>When he struck it, three tiny baby birds scurried from under their dead mother’s wings. The loving mother, keenly aware of impend- ing disaster, had carried her offspring to the base of the tree and had gathered them under her wings. She could have flown to safety but had refused to abandon her babies. What a picture of the believer who is safe in Christ!<br><br>The fires of God’s judgment burned themselves out on Him, at Calvary, and all who are in Christ are safe forever beneath His wings. At the cross, Christ was judged as a condemned sinner so that we could be judged as righteous citizens of the heavenly kingdom. He was judged as a criminal so that we could be set free from the destructive fires of eternal loss, both figuratively and, yes, literally, as well.<br></p>",

          "lessonText": "<p>As we have already seen, there must be a judgment before Christ comes. The angel announces in a loud voice that “ ‘the hour of His judgment has come’ ” (Rev. 14:7, NKJV). The book of Daniel gives us the time when this judgment begins.<br><br><strong>Read Daniel 8:14.

Although Daniel understood the concept of the cleansing of the sanctuary and the judgment, he was confused about the 2,300 days.<br><br><strong>Read Daniel 8:27 and Daniel 9:21, 22.

That is, the vision of the 2,300 days (the rest of the vision already had been explained [see Daniel 8:19–22]). The next chapter, Daniel 9, records the angel Gabriel coming to explain to Daniel the 2,300-day prophecy. “ ‘O Daniel, I have now come forth to give you skill to under- stand’ ” (Dan. 9:22, NKJV).<br><br>Gabriel amazes Daniel as he reveals an answer to his prayer much broader than he ever imagined. The angel Gabriel took Daniel down the stream of time and revealed the truth about the coming Messiah, giving the exact dates of the beginning of His ministry and His cruel death, events that tied directly to the cleansing of the sanctuary, in Daniel 8. In other words, Christ’s death and the judgment are inseparably linked.<br><br><strong>Why is it significant that the death of Jesus, as revealed in Daniel 9:24–27, is directly linked to the judgment, in Daniel 8:14?

What time period does the angel declare that the vision of Daniel 8 and the 2,300 days apply to, and why is that important to understand?</strong><br><br>Daniel 8:17, 19, 26<strong><br><br><sup>17 </sup></strong>So he came near where I stood, and when he came I was afraid and fell on my face; but he said to me, “Understand, son of man, that the vision refers to the time of the end.<strong><br><br><sup>19</sup></strong> And he said, “Look, I am making known to you what shall happen in the latter time of the indignation; for at the appointed time the end shall be.<strong><br><br><sup>26</sup></strong> “And the vision of the evenings and mornings Which was told is true; Therefore seal up the vision, For it refers to many days in the future.”<br><br>Some argue that the 2,300 days are literal days. They also believe that this little horn of Daniel 8 applies to the Seleucid military leader Antiochus Epiphanes (216 b.c.–164 b.c.), who attacked Jerusalem and defiled the Jewish temple, even though 2,300 days does not fit even his time frame. This interpretation, however, is contrary to the angel’s clear instruction that the vision applies to the “time of the end.” Antiochus Epiphanes certainly did not live at the time of the end.<br><br>In Daniel 8, Gabriel begins his explanation of the 2,300-day prophecy. He names the ram as representing Media-Persia and the male goat as representing Greece (Dan. 8:20, 21). Though not named, as are the two powers before it, the next entity, the little horn, is obviously Rome (Dan. 8:9, 23, 24). He then depicts a kind of religiopolitical phase of Rome, which would “cast down the truth to the ground” (Dan. 8:10–12, 25) and interfere with Christ’s heavenly ministry (Dan. 8:10–12). The cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8:14, the climax of the chapter, is God’s answer to the challenge of earthly and religious powers that have attempted to usurp the authority of God. It is part of God’s divine solu- tion to the sin problem.<br><br>Gabriel is ready to explain the details in God’s prophetic timetable. At the end of Daniel 8, we can clearly see that Daniel did not understand the part of the vision about the 2,300 days (Dan. 8:27). The earlier part about the ram, the goat, and the little horn had all been explained, even with the first two powers outright identified by name (Dan. 8:20, 21). The cleansing of the sanctuary was, however, not explained.<br><br>The angel Gabriel, who appeared in Daniel 8, appears now in Daniel 9 and says to him: “ ‘At the beginning of your supplications the com- mand went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision’ ” (Dan. 9:23, NKJV). What vision? As we will see tomorrow, it is the vision of the 2,300 days, the only part of the previous vision, in Daniel 8, that he hadn’t explained yet to Daniel.<br><strong><br>Gabriel called Daniel “greatly beloved.” What does this tell us about the intimate link between heaven and earth?</strong><br></p>",

          "lessonText": "<p><strong>Read Daniel 9:23. What specific instruction does the angel give to Daniel? Why is this significant in understanding the meaning of the cleansing of the sanctuary in Daniel 8:14?</strong><br><br>Daniel 9:23<strong><br><br><sup>23</sup></strong> At the beginning of your supplications the [a]command went out, and I have come to tell you, for you are greatly beloved; therefore consider the matter, and understand the vision:<br><br>Daniel 8:14<strong><br><br><sup>14</sup></strong> And he said to me, “For two thousand three hundred [a]days; then the sanctuary shall be cleansed.”<br><br>The angel plainly instructed Daniel to “ ‘consider the matter, and understand the vision’ ” (Dan. 9:23, NKJV). What matter, and what vision? Because there is no vision recorded in Daniel 9, the angel Gabriel must be speaking of the portion of the vision in Daniel 8 that the prophet did not understand—the vision of the 2,300 days (Daniel 8:27).<br><br><strong>Gabriel continues in Daniel 9:24–27. What events in the life and min- istry of Jesus is this about?</strong><br><br>Daniel 9:24–27<strong><br><br><sup>24</sup></strong> “Seventy weeks are determined For your people and for your holy city, To finish the transgression, To make an end of sins, To make reconciliation for iniquity, To bring in everlasting righteousness, To seal up vision and prophecy, And to anoint the Most Holy.<strong><br><br><sup>25</sup></strong> “Know therefore and understand, That from the going forth of the command To restore and build Jerusalem Until Messiah the Prince, There shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, Even in troublesome times.<strong><br><br><sup>26</sup></strong> “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary.

And on the wing of abominations shall be one who makes desolate, Even until the consummation, which is determined, Is poured out on the desolate.”<br><br>The first portion of this prophecy relates to God’s people, the Jews. “ ‘Seventy weeks are determined for your people’ ”—the Jewish nation (Dan. 9:24, NKJV). In Bible prophecy, one prophetic day equals one lit- eral prophetic year (Ezek. 4:6, Num. 14:34). In Daniel and Revelation, when you have symbolic imagery, you usually have a symbolic time prophecy, as well. One of the ways we can be certain that the day-year principle of prophecy applies here is that when we use it in Daniel’s prophecy, each event on the time line comes out perfectly (see tomor- row’s lesson). If we apply this principle, 70 weeks are composed of 490 days. Since one prophetic day equals one literal year, 490 days are 490 literal years.<br><br>Gabriel tells Daniel that 490 years are “cut off ” (the literal mean- ing of the Hebrew word chathak, sometimes translated “determined”). Cut off from what? It only could be the other time prophecy alluded to here: the 2,300 days of Daniel 8:14. These 490 years, which are a time prophecy, are directly linked back to the time prophecy of Daniel 8:14, the only part of the vision left unexplained in Daniel 8 and the only time prophecy in Daniel 8, as well. Thus, we can see that Gabriel with this prophecy is coming to help Daniel understand what he didn’t understand in the previous chapter: the 2,300 days.<br></p>",

          "lessonText": "<p>Gabriel began this 490-year prophecy with an event that was extremely important to Daniel and to the Jews—the command to restore and build Jerusalem. Though various decrees had been passed regarding Jerusalem, in Ezra 7, we discover that the decree passed in 457 b.c. allowed the Jews not only to return to their homeland but also to establish themselves as a religious community (see Ezra 7:13, 27).<br><br>It is significant to note that Artaxerxes’s decree was issued in the autumn of 457 b.c. From this decree, in 457 b.c., to the Messiah, according to Daniel, would be 69 weeks, or 483 years. If we begin at 457 b.c. and move forward on history’s time line, we arrive at a.d. 27.<br><br>The word Messiah means “the anointed one.” In a.d. 27, Jesus Christ, the Messiah, was baptized. (See Matt. 3:13–17.) Daniel predicted hun- dreds of years in advance the exact year for the baptism of Christ, the time at which Jesus would begin His three and a half years of ministry.<br><br><strong>Read Romans 5:6–9 along with Daniel 9:26. What great truths are revealed here?</strong><br><br>Romans 5:6–9<strong><br><br><sup>6 </sup></strong>For when we were still without strength, [a]in due time Christ died for the ungodly.<strong><br><br><sup>7</sup></strong> For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.<strong><br><br><sup>8</sup></strong> But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.<strong><br><br><sup>9</sup></strong> Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.<br><br>Daniel 9:26<br><sup><br><strong>26</strong></sup> “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall [a]be cut off, but not for Himself; And the people of the prince who is to come Shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end of it shall be with a flood, And till the end of the war desolations are determined.<br><br>“ ‘And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself’ ” (Dan. 9:26, NKJV). The Messiah would be “cut off,” or crucified. The verse adds “ ‘but not for Himself.’ ” In other words, the death of Christ on Calvary’s cross was for us, not for Himself, which is why Paul could write: “But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom. 5:8, NKJV).<br><br>In Daniel 9:27, we read that in the middle of the week, the last seven years, Christ would “ ‘bring an end to sacrifice and offering’ ” (NKJV). In the middle of this seventieth week, in a.d. 31, Christ confirmed the everlasting covenant with His blood by dying on the cross, and the sacrificial system lost any and all prophetic significance.<br><br>These prophecies reveal that Christ, the Messiah, would be crucified and cause the sacrificial system to cease its prophetic importance in the spring of a.d. 31. These predictions were fulfilled in every detail. Exactly at Passover, when the high priest was offering the Passover lamb, Christ was sacrificed for us.<strong><br><br>With what has been written above in mind, read Mark 15:38 and Matthew 3:15, 16. How do these verses help us understand the prophecy of Daniel 9:24–27?</strong><br></p>",

Since 1844, we have been living in the judgment hour, and Revelation’s message of the first angel proclaims, “ ‘The hour of His judgment has come’ ” (Rev. 14:7, NKJV).

His father wasn’t a Christian and lived far away in Iran.</p><p>Grandmother didn’t like the way that Anas was being treated at school. Upset over the bullying, she finally transferred the boy to the local Seventh- day Adventist school.</p><p>At first, Anas was withdrawn and spoke little. But he loved the Bible classes so much that he tried to remember the teacher’s words by whis- pering them as he heard them in the classroom. As the days and weeks passed, he began to open up and make jokes. The other children enjoyed his wit, and he soon became the class clown. He received his very own Bible.</p><p>His mother was furious when she learned that Anas was attending the Adventist school, and she took him away from Grandmother to live with her. She refused to speak with Grandmother, and she taught Anas at home.</p><p>Grandmother prayed for God to intervene. She prayed every day for a year. After some time, Mother began speaking to her again. They became friends again.</p><p>One day, Mother agreed to Grandmother’s suggestion to meet with an Adventist pastor.

The pastor was surprised. They asked Anas some questions. It turned out that he had been studying his Bible on his own during the year that he had been living with Mother.

Two weeks later, Mother and Grandmother watched as the 11-year-old boy was baptized with his three friends from the Adventist school.</p>",
