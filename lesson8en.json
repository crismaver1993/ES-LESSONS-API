We look at our circumstances and then begin to wonder whether God really loves us, because if He really did, things would be different.<br><br>There are two rationales that often lead us to doubt God’s goodness. First, when we have a burning desire in our hearts and minds for some- thing that we believe is good, the idea that God might want something different for us may seem ridiculous. Second, we may doubt God’s goodness because our experience clashes with what we believe. If something looks good or feels good or sounds good or tastes good, then it must be good. And so we get angry with God when we can’t have it.<br><br>This is where faith comes into play. Faith comes into action precisely at those times we are tempted to doubt God and His goodness. <br></p><p><strong>Romans 8:28–39 is a powerful passage that describes the goodness of God toward us. What reasons can you find in the text that can guard our minds against doubting God’s goodness?</strong><br></p><p><strong>Romans 8:28–39 <br></strong></p><p><sup><strong>28 </strong></sup>And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>29 </strong></sup>For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.<sup><br><br><strong>31 </strong></sup>What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>32</strong></sup> He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>33</strong></sup> Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>34</strong></sup> Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>35</strong></sup> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>36 </strong></sup>As it is written:<br><br>“For Your sake we are killed all day long;<br>We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.”<sup><br><br><strong>37 </strong></sup>Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>38 </strong></sup>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,</p><p><sup><strong>39 </strong></sup>nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br></p><p>In Romans 8:32, there is an important piece of logic that is extremely helpful in guarding us from becoming overwhelmed by our circumstances. “If God didn’t hesitate to put everything on the line for us, embracing our condition and exposing himself to the worst by sending his own Son, is there anything else he wouldn’t gladly and freely do for us?” (The Message). How could we possibly think that God would send Jesus to die for us and then turn mean and stingy?<br><br>This means that the truth of God’s generosity to us, seen in the death of Christ, must have a stronger impact in our thinking than all of the doubts that the crucible may generate inside us.<br><br><strong>How is it possible for a truth (God’s goodness) to have a more powerful effect on you than your doubts? Spend some time meditating on the truth that God has given Jesus to die in your place, and that this incredible generosity continues in a thousand different ways for you today.

The One who had been their support and encouragement was going to heaven, and the disciples were beginning to feel confused and powerless. But though the disciples would not be able to see Him physically any longer, Jesus gave them a remarkable promise.<br><br><strong>Read John 14:1–14. According to verses 13 and 14, Jesus promises to do for us “anything” that we ask in His name. Because of this, we almost always add on to the end of our prayers, “In Jesus’ name, amen.”</strong><br><strong></strong></p><p><strong>John 14:1–14</strong></p><p><sup><strong>1 </strong></sup>“Let not your heart be troubled; you believe in God, believe also in Me. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> In My Father’s house are many mansions; if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>3</strong></sup> And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am, there you may be also. <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>4</strong></sup> And where I go you know, and the way you know.”<sup><br><br><strong>5</strong></sup> Thomas said to Him, “Lord, we do not know where You are going, and how can we know the way?”<sup><br><br><strong>6</strong></sup> Jesus said to him, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.<sup><br><br><strong>7 </strong></sup>“If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and from now on you know Him and have seen Him.”<sup><br><br><strong>8 </strong></sup>Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”<sup><br><br><strong>9 </strong></sup>Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? <sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>10 </strong></sup>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me?

What does Jesus mean when He encourages us to pray like this? What clues are there in these verses that help us to understand the point He’s making?<br></strong><br>When our request is “in the name of Jesus,” we can be certain that the whole machinery of heaven is at work on our behalf. We may not see the angels working all around us. But they are—sent from the throne of heaven in the name of Jesus, to fulfill our requests.<br><br>Sometimes when we pray in the name of Jesus, we open our eyes and expect everything to be different around us—but it all looks the same. However, while the power of God may come with dramatic effect, as when Jesus calmed the storm, it also may come in quietness, unnoticed, as when the power of God sustained Jesus in Gethsemane. Something dramatic may not suddenly happen, but that doesn’t mean that God is not at work for us.<br><strong><br>Read John 14:1–14 </strong>again. As you read, imagine that Jesus is talking directly to you, face-to-face. What hope and encouragement can you draw from these promises? At the same time, ask yourself, “What things in my life could be standing in the way of having these promises fulfilled for me? What changes must I purpose in my heart to make?”<br></p>",

How God must long to do this for us. Yet, amazingly, we manage to hang on to our problems until we are about to snap.

To cast means to do just that, to throw, to give away, so that what is causing the aching and the concern no longer has any connection to you. But, of course, our burdens are not thrown just anywhere. Our worry does not disappear into a void. It is given to our Father in heaven, who promises to sort it out. That’s what Jesus is telling us in the verses in Matthew. The problem in doing this is not that it’s hard; rather, it’s that it just seems too easy, too good to be true.<br><br>Anxiety is caused by all sorts of things. It could be due to pressure from work, unexpected criticism, feeling that we are unwanted or unloved, health or financial worries, feeling that we are not good enough for God, or believing that we are not forgiven.<br><br>Whatever the reasons are, one reason we hang on to our problems is that we think we can sort them out better than anyone else can. But Peter urges us to reconsider any such idea. The reason we don’t have to worry is that God cares. But does God still care enough to intervene when a divorce is looming or we feel totally useless? The Bible says that He cares enough to transform any situation.<br><strong><br>What are things that cause you worry now? However legitimate they are, however troublesome they are, is there anything too hard for the Lord? Maybe our biggest problem is that even though we believe that God knows about it and can fix it, we don’t believe that He will resolve it the way we would like it resolved.

And is not this Spirit a real, true actual guide? Some men seem afraid to take God at His word, as though it would be presumption in them. They pray for the Lord to teach us and yet are afraid to credit the pledged word of God and believe we have been taught of Him. So long as we come to our heavenly Father humbly and with a spirit to be taught, willing and anxious to learn, why should we doubt God’s fulfillment of His own promise? You must not for a moment doubt Him and dishonor Him thereby.

He gathered the images and the stone altars where he had sacrificed animals and bowed to evil spirits. At the spirits’ request, Father shipped the temple paraphernalia to two women in another town.<br><br>He finished the task on a Friday. As he got into his car, evil spirits growled that they were going to kill him. Suddenly, a dark shadow shaped like a man and comprised of three spirits entered the car. The spirits showed Father a distant light. Out of the light loomed a cross, filled with mud. The spirits sneered that it was the end for Father. “As a dead man, can I make a last statement?” Father asked. Without waiting for a reply, he said, “Jesus, please sit beside me in the car and take me home.” The dark shadow vanished. It was the first time that Father had called on Jesus, and he felt protected.<br><br>The next morning, Father attended Sabbath worship services for the first time. It was a Communion Sabbath, and he sensed a supernatural energy similar to what he had experienced at Junior’s baptism. As someone washed his feet, Father’s sins passed before his eyes. Tears flowed as he asked God for forgiveness. He felt as though the Holy Spirit was washing him clean. A short time later, Father proposed to Mother, and they officially got married. Mother was especially happy. Now she could be baptized.<br><br>The day before her baptism, Father and Junior went to Alpha Seventh-day Adventist Community Church to listen as Mother rehearsed with a choir. A ladder, which was being used to decorate the church, suddenly toppled over, and the man standing on it slammed into Father, knocking him to the floor. Father offered assurances that he was fine but, a moment later, began to shriek. Two evil spirits had possessed him.<br><br>Junior ran to Father. He lay on the ground, his body quivering. A spirit snarled through his mouth that he had wanted to kill Father with the ladder. Junior had heard about the great controversy between Christ and Satan, but he had never witnessed it in real life. He prayed. The choir spontaneously sang, “Jesus Christ, You are the Bridegroom, the Sower, my Father and my Shepherd, the Pearl of Great Price. Christ, You are everything.”<br><br>Mother grabbed Father’s twisted hands and tried to straighten them. They felt terribly cold. A spirit spewed hatred at her.<br><br>Then Father spoke in a small and distant voice. “It hurts,” he said. After about an hour of praying and singing, Father returned to normal.<br><br>Although in pain, Father joined Junior at church for Mother’s baptism on Sabbath morning. With joy, Mother sank into the water.<br></p>",
