          "lessonText": "<p>If Scripture is clear about one thing, it is the reality of judgment. God will judge the world. The texts, both in the Old Testament and the New, are numerous and without ambiguity. The justice so lacking here and now will one day come. The Bible says that God has “  ‘perfect knowledge’  ” (Job 37:16, NIV) and “knows everything” (1 John 3:20, NIV), including our most secret intentions (Eccles. 12:14, Jer. 17:10). We can hide from everyone and everything else, but nothing is hidden from God. What this reality implies is that He does not need a judgment for Himself to know the life of each individual. God’s judgments are, indeed, a divine accommodation, carried on for the sake of His creatures, both in heaven and on earth. This process is of a cosmic-historical nature because Lucifer began his rebellion in heaven and then spread it to this world (Rev. 12:7–9). During this week we will consider the end-time judgment process with its three main phases: the pre-Advent judgment, the millennial judgment, and the executive judgment. The whole process ends with the vindication of the righteous and the second death of the wicked.</p>",

          "lessonText": "<p>For many, the idea of judgment means condemnation. And though that’s part of the process, we mustn’t forget that the idea of judgment has a positive side, in that judgment also involves the vindication of the righteous. Actually, the book of Daniel refers to an end-time judgment “ ‘in favor of the saints of the Most High’ ” (Dan. 7:22, NKJV). God’s judgment includes both—a principle found in this Old Testament text: “ ‘Then hear in heaven, and act, and judge Your servants, condemning the wicked, bringing his way on his head, and justifying the righteous by giving him according to his righteousness’ ” (1 Kings 8:32, NKJV).\n</p><p><strong>Read Matthew 25:31–46 and John 5:21–29. How did Christ point to the concepts of both condemnation and vindication in the final judgment?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Matthew 25:31–46\n</strong></p><p><sup><strong>31</strong> </sup>“When the Son of Man comes in His glory, and all the [a]holy angels with Him, then He will sit on the throne of His glory.\n</p><p><strong><sup>32</sup></strong> All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats.\n</p><p><sup><strong>33</strong> </sup>And He will set the sheep on His right hand, but the goats on the left.\n</p><p><strong><sup>34</sup></strong> Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:\n</p><p><strong><sup>35</sup></strong> for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in;\n</p><p><strong><sup>36</sup> </strong>I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’\n</p><p><strong><sup>37</sup></strong> “Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink?\n</p><p><strong><sup>38</sup></strong> When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You?\n</p><p><strong><sup>39</sup></strong> Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’\n</p><p><strong><sup>40</sup></strong> And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’\n</p><p><strong><sup>41</sup> </strong>“Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:\n</p><p><strong><sup>42</sup> </strong>for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink;\n</p><p><strong><sup>43</sup></strong> I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’\n</p><p><strong><sup>44</sup> </strong>“Then they also will answer [b]Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’\n</p><p><strong><sup>45</sup></strong> Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’\n</p><p><strong><sup>46</sup></strong> And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”\n</p><p><strong>John 5:21–29\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>21</sup></strong> For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom He will.\n</p><p><strong><sup>22</sup> </strong>For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgment to the Son,\n</p><p><strong><sup>23</sup> </strong>that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.\n</p><p><strong><sup>24</sup></strong> “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.\n</p><p><strong><sup>25</sup></strong> Most assuredly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.\n</p><p><strong><sup>26</sup> </strong>For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,\n</p><p><strong><sup>27</sup></strong> and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of Man.\n</p><p><strong><sup>28</sup></strong><sup> </sup>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice\n</p><p><strong><sup>29</sup> </strong>and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.\n</p><p>Some claim that the expressions “ ‘is not judged’ ” (John 3:18, NASB) and “ ‘will not be judged’ ” (John 5:24, NIV) mean that those who are in Christ are not judged at all. But these expressions imply that believers are not condemned in the judgment. Hence the texts should be understood as saying “ ‘is not condemned’ ” (John 3:18, NIV) and “ ‘shall not come into condemnation’ ” (John 5:24). In short, our destiny is determined in our present life. Those in Christ have their vindication at the judgment already assured, and those who are not in Christ remain under condemnation. Describing the judgment (Matt. 25:31–46), Christ mentioned the presence not only of the goats (wicked) but also of the sheep (righteous). And the apostle Paul stated explicitly, “For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each may receive recompense for what has been done in the body, whether good or evil” (2 Cor. 5:10, NRSV). While reflecting on the judgment, we should keep in mind that we are saved by grace (Isa. 55:1, Eph. 2:8–10), justified by faith (Gen. 15:6, Rom. 5:1), and judged by works (Eccles. 12:14, Matt. 25:31–46, Rev. 20:11–13). The basis of the judgment process is God’s moral law as summarized in the Ten Commandments (Eccles. 12:13, 14; James 1:25; James 2:8–17). Our works are the external evidences of the genuineness of our saving experience and, consequently, the elements to be appraised during judgment.\n</p><p><strong>Remember: </strong>there is no arbitrary decree from God electing some to be saved and others to be lost. Each one is morally responsible for his or her own destiny. In the end, the judgment is not the time when God decides to accept or reject us, but the time when God finalizes our choice as to whether or not we have accepted Him—a choice made manifest by our works.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

          "lessonText": "<p>The concept of judgment before the return of Christ, or what we call a “pre-Advent” judgment, is found in many places in Scripture.\n</p><p><strong>Read Daniel 7:9–14; Matthew 22:1–14; Revelation 11:1, 18, 19; and Revelation 14:6, 7. How do these passages shed light on the notion of a pre-Advent investigative judgment in the heavenly courtroom? What is the significance of such a judgment?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Daniel 7:9–14\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>9</sup></strong> “I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of Days was seated; his garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool. his throne was a fiery flame, its wheels a burning fire;\n</p><p><sup><strong>10</strong> </sup>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. a thousand thousands ministered to Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated, and the books were opened.\n</p><p><strong><sup>11</sup> </strong>“I watched then because of the sound of the [c]pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed and given to the burning flame.\n</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a season and a time.\n</p><p><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> “I was watching in the night visions, and behold, One like the Son of Man, coming with the clouds of heaven! he came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought Him near before Him.\n</p><p><strong><sup>14</sup></strong> Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and His kingdom the one which shall not be destroyed.\n</p><p><strong>Matthew 22:1–14\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup> </strong>And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said:\n</p><p><sup><strong>2</strong> </sup>“The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son,\n</p><p><strong><sup>3</sup> </strong>and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come.\n</p><p><strong><sup>4</sup> </strong>Again, he sent out other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.” <strong>’\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business.\n</p><p><strong><sup>6</sup> </strong>And the rest seized his servants, treated them [a]spitefully, and killed them.\n</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.\n</p><p><strong><sup>8 </sup></strong>Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.\n</p><p><sup><strong>9</strong> </sup>Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding.’\n</p><p><strong><sup>10</sup></strong> So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.\n</p><p><strong><sup>11</sup></strong> “But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw a man there who did not have on a wedding garment.\n</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> So he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here without a wedding garment?’ And he was speechless.\n</p><p><strong><sup>13</sup></strong> Then the king said to the servants, ‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’\n</p><p><strong>Revelation 11:1\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, “Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there.\n</p><p><strong>Revelation 11:18-19\n</strong></p><p><sup><strong>18</strong> </sup>The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those who destroy the earth.”\n</p><p><strong><sup>19</sup> </strong>Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His temple. And there were lightnings, noises, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail.\n</p><p><strong>Revelation 14:6-7\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Then I saw another angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach to those who dwell on the earth—to every nation, tribe, tongue, and people.\n</p><p><strong><sup>7</sup></strong> saying with a loud voice, “Fear God and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and worship Him who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water.”\n</p><p>The concept of a pre-Advent investigative judgment of God’s people is grounded in three basic biblical teachings. One is the notion that all the dead—righteous or unrighteous— remain unconscious in their graves until the final resurrections (John 5:25–29). The second is the existence of a universal judgment of all human beings (2 Cor. 5:10, Rev. 20:11–13). The third is the fact that the first resurrection will be the blessed reward for the righteous, and the second resurrection will be eternal death for the wicked (John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:4–6, 12–15). What this means is that if all human beings will be judged, they should be judged prior to their respective resurrections, because at those resurrections they will receive their final rewards. The book of Daniel helps us to understand both the time and the nature of that pre-Advent judgment. At the end of the 2,300 symbolic days—in 1844—the heavenly sanctuary would be cleansed (Dan. 8:14, compare with Heb. 9:23) and the pre-Advent investigative judgment would begin (Dan. 7:9–14), two different ways of expressing the same event. And the judgment is “ ‘in favor of the saints of the Most High’ ” (Dan. 7:22, NKJV). That is, it’s good news for God’s people. In Matthew 22:1–14, Jesus spoke of an investigation of the wedding guests before the wedding feast actually started.\n</p><p>And in the book of Revelation, the pre-Advent investigative judgment is referred to in the task of measuring “ ‘those who worship’ ” in the temple of God (Rev. 11:1, NKJV) and in the announcement that “ ‘the hour of His judgment has come’ ” (Rev. 14:6, 7, NKJV; compare with Rev. 14:14–16).\n</p><p><strong>How should our knowledge of a judgment in heaven impact how we live here on earth?</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

So, during the millennium, while this earth remains desolate, the saints will reign with Christ in heaven (Jer. 4:23, Rev. 20:4).\n</p><p><strong>Read 1 Corinthians 6:2, 3 and Revelation 20:4–6, 11–13.

Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshiped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for [a]a thousand years.\n</p><p><strong><sup>5</sup></strong> But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.\n</p><p><strong><sup>6</sup></strong> Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.

And there was found no place for them.\n</p><p><strong><sup>12</sup></strong> And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before [a]God, and books were opened.

And they were judged, each one according to his works.\n</p><p>The whole judgment process is intended (1) to vindicate God’s character against the accusations of Satan that God is unfair in the way He treats His creatures; (2) to confirm the impartiality of the rewards of the righteous; (3) to demonstrate the justice of the punishments of the wicked; and (4) to dissipate all doubts that could lead toward another rebellion in the universe. In the pre-Advent investigative judgment of the righteous, only the heavenly hosts are involved (Dan. 7:9, 10). But during the millennial judgment of the wicked and the fallen angels, the saints themselves also will participate (1 Cor. 6:3, Jude 6, Rev. 20:4–6). The pre-Advent investigative judgment began in 1844 when “ ‘thrones were put in place. . . . The court was seated, and the books were opened’ ”\n</p><p>Dan. 7:9, 10, NKJV). The millennial judgment, however, will start after the saints are taken to heaven and sit on thrones, and the judgment is committed to them. Then, once more, the heavenly books are opened, and the dead are “judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books” (Rev. 20:4, 12, NKJV). This process provides an opportunity for the saints to evaluate the heavenly records and to see God’s fair treatment in all cases. He not only rewards all human beings according to what they deserve based on their own decisions but also explains to them why He does so.\n</p><p><strong>What does it teach us about the character of God that before any of the sleeping lost are resurrected to face the second death, the saved will be involved in the judging process, and no one will be punished until we, too, see the justice and fairness of God?

Today the tendency is to describe Him as a loving, permissive Father who never punishes His children. Yet, love without justice will turn into chaos and lawlessness, and justice without love will become oppression and subjugation. God’s judging process is a perfect blend of justice and mercy, both of which derive from His unconditional love. The executive judgment is God’s final and irreversible punitive intervention in human history. Limited punitive judgments occurred, for example, in the casting out of Satan and his rebellious angels from heaven (Rev. 12:7–12), the driving out of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3), the great Flood (Genesis 6–8), the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19, Jude 7), the death of the firstborn in Egypt (Exodus 11, Exodus 12), and the deaths of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1–11).

It is not for a man—a criminal against God’s holy law, pardoned only through the great sacrifice He made in giving His Son to die for the guilty because His law was changeless—to dictate to God.”—Ellen G. White, Manuscript Releases, vol. 12, p. 208. All that God could have done to save humanity from being eternally lost He did, even at a great cost to Himself. Those who are lost ultimately made choices that led them to this unfortunate end. The idea that God’s judgment on the lost, even the annihilation of the lost (as opposed to eternal torment), goes against the character of a loving God is simply wrong. It’s God’s love, and God’s love alone, that demands justice, as well.\n</p><p><strong>What does the Cross itself teach us about what God was willing to do in order to save everyone who would be saved?</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

How effective are the “lake of fire” and the “second death”?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Malachi 4:1\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> “For behold, the day is coming, burning like an oven, and all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble. And the day which is coming shall burn them up,”says the Lord of hosts, “That will leave them neither root nor branch.\n</p><p><strong>Revelation 20:14-15\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>14</sup> </strong>Then Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death.\n</p><p><strong><sup>15</sup></strong> And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire.\n</p><p><strong>Revelation 21:8\n</strong></p><p><strong><sup>8</sup> </strong>But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.”\n</p><p>The final destruction of Satan and his angels and all the wicked will cleanse the universe from sin and its consequences. And yet, even the final destruction of the wicked is an act of God’s love, not only for the saints but also for the wicked themselves. They would rather die than live in the presence of God who is a “consuming fire” for sin (Heb. 12:29). “They [the lost] would long to flee from that holy place. They would welcome destruction, that they might be hidden from the face of Him who died to redeem them. The destiny of the wicked is fixed by their own choice. Their exclusion from heaven is voluntary with themselves, and just and merciful on the part of God.”—Ellen G. White, The Great Controversy, p. 543. Thus, the final annihilation of sin and sinners—in contrast to the unbiblical theory of their everlasting sufferings in hell—provides a just and proportional punishment for whatever evil people had committed. It also confirms that sin had a beginning and will have an end. Then the whole universe will return to its original perfection, before sin, evil, and disobedience arose mysteriously and without any justification. Praise the Lord that He, as our “righteous Judge” (2 Tim. 4:8, NKJV), will make the fair decision of granting immortality to the righteous and eternal destruction to the wicked.\n</p><p><strong>What would be wrong with the idea that God saves everyone in the end?

White, “Without a Wedding Garment,” pp. 307–319, in Christ’s Object Lessons; “Desolation of the Earth,” pp. 653–661; “The Controversy Ended,” pp. 662–673, in The Great Controversy.\n</p><p>“In the day of final judgment, every lost soul will understand the nature of his own rejection of truth. The cross will be presented, and its real bearing will be seen by every mind that has been blinded by transgression. Before the vision of Calvary with its mysterious Victim, sinners will stand condemned. Every lying excuse will be swept away. Human apostasy will appear in its heinous character. Men will see what their choice has been. Every question of truth and error in the long-standing controversy will then have been made plain. In the judgment of the universe, God will stand clear of blame for the existence or continuance of evil. It will be demonstrated that the divine decrees are not accessory to sin. There was no defect in God’s government, no cause for disaffection. When the thoughts of all hearts shall be revealed, both the loyal and the rebellious will unite in declaring, ‘Just and true are Thy ways, Thou King of saints. Who shall not fear Thee, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? . . . for Thy judgments are made manifest.’ Rev. 15:3, 4.”—Ellen G. White, The Desire of Ages, p. 58.\n</p><p><strong>Discussion Questions:\n</strong></p><p><strong>1 .</strong>“If you cling to self, refusing to yield your will to God, you are choosing death. To sin, wherever found, God is a consuming fire. If you choose sin, and refuse to separate from it, the presence of God, which consumes sin, must consume you.”—Ellen G. White, Thoughts From the Mount of Blessing, p. 62. How does this quote help us understand the nature of the executive judgment?\n</p><p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Dwell on the idea (presented at the end of Tuesday’s study) that not one of the lost will face final judgment until after the redeemed have been part of the judging process. Again, what does this teach us about the openness and transparency of God? For a universe in which love reigns, why is this transparency so important?\n</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>How will the participation of the saints in the millennial judgment comfort them in regard to their loved ones who will be lost?</p><p><strong>Inside Story</strong>:</p><p><strong>Two Dreams in Angola, By Andrew McChesney</strong></p><p>Every time he went to church, little William Frederico João Lumbo seemed to hear the preacher say the same phrase. The big preacher stood behind the pulpit in the church in Angola. He raised a hand into the air, and thundered, “Those who do not live to serve God are not fit to live!” The preacher’s words made a big impression on his young mind. But the world outside the church also made a big impression, and he decided that he would rather dance than go to church. At age 14, he formed a dance group and performed at parties and school events in Angola’s capital, Luanda. Even though William enjoyed dancing, something didn’t seem right. He felt an emptiness inside, and he remembered the words of the preacher, “Those who do not live to serve God are not fit to live.” The joy from dancing faded, and William began to smoke and drink. But he felt increasingly empty. One day, he prayed desperately, “I am not living to serve You, and I am not fit to live. Help!”\n</p><p>Shortly after the prayer, a friend gave William a flash drive with a sermon on it. William wanted the flash drive because, on it, the friend also had saved a video of him dancing. The sermon touched William’s heart. He fell to his knees and asked for forgiveness. He decided to go to church. All churches were closed in Angola because of COVID-19, and William ended up in an Adventist house church. A big surprise awaited William. The leader of the house church, Filipe, had had two dreams about William over the past two nights. In the first dream, Filipe was standing beside a big tree, and, in his hand, he held a small branch. He needed to somehow connect the branch to the tree so it could grow again. In the second dream, Filipe was standing beside a big river. A small river flowed beside the big river, and Felipe somehow needed to connect the small river to the big river.\n</p><p>“You are the small branch that needs to be connected to the big tree,” Filipe told William. “The big tree is Jesus, who is the Tree of Life. You are the small river, and the big river is Jesus. You need to be connected to Jesus, who is the River of Life.” William could scarcely believe his ears. “Jesus wants me to be connected to Him?” he asked. As William worshiped at the house church, peace and joy began to fill the emptiness in his heart. He decided to be connected only to Jesus. Today, William couldn’t be happier. He lives only to serve God.\n</p><p><em>This mission story illustrates Spiritual Growth Objective No. 5 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church’s “I Will Go” strategic plan, “To disciple individuals and families into Spirit-filled lives.” Read more: IWillGo2020.org</em></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",
