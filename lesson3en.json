I will be your protector and provider.” Then, much later, Moses told Israel as they were about to enter Canaan, “ ‘You shall truly tithe all the increase of your grain that the field produces year by year . . . that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always’ ” (Deut. 14:22, 23, NKJV).<br><br>Ellen G.

Tithe is simply returning 10 percent of our income, or increase, to God. We understand that all we have belongs to Him in the first place. The tithing legislation given to Israel at Mount Sinai points out that the tithe is holy and belongs to God (see Lev. 27:30, 32). God asks only for His 10 percent. Our offerings of gratitude are separate from and in addition to the tithe. The tithe is the minimum testimony of our Christian commitment. Nowhere in the Bible do we find any indication that God’s portion is less than a tenth.<br><br><strong>Read Genesis 14:18–20 and Hebrews 7:1–9. What was Abram’s response to meeting Melchizedek?

The last mention of tithe in the Bible recalls the same encounter, but the words “tenth” and “tithe” are used interchangeably (see Heb. 7:1–9). Note in the Hebrews story that neither Melchizedek nor Christ were of the tribe of Levi, so tithing precedes and follows the selection of the Levites. Tithing is not exclusively a Jewish custom and did not originate with the Hebrews at Sinai.<br><br><strong>Read Genesis 28:13, 14, 20–22. What did God promise to do for Jacob, and what was Jacob’s response to God?</strong><br><br><strong>Genesis 28:13, 14</strong><br><br><sup>13</sup>&nbsp;And behold, the Lord stood above it and said: “I am the Lord God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and your descendants.<br><br><sup>14</sup>&nbsp;Also your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread abroad to the west and the east, to the north and the south; and in you and in your seed all the families of the earth shall be blessed.<br><br><strong>Genesis 28: 20–22</strong><br><br><sup>20</sup>&nbsp;Then Jacob made a vow, saying, “If God will be with me, and keep me in this way that I am going, and give me bread to eat and clothing to put on,<br><br><sup>21</sup>&nbsp;so that I come back to my father’s house in peace, then the Lord shall be my God.<br><br><sup>22</sup>&nbsp;And this stone which I have set as a pillar shall be God’s house, and of all that You give me I will surely give a [a]tenth to You.”<br><br>When Jacob left home, running from his angry brother, Esau, one night he had a dream of a staircase that ascended from earth to heaven. Angels were going up and down on it. And God stood at the top and promised to be with Jacob and someday bring him back home. This single young man had a real conversion experience and said, “ ‘The LORD shall be my God. . . . And of all that You give me I will surely give a tenth to You’ ” (Gen. 28:21, 22, NKJV).<br><br><strong>Why is it important to understand that tithing, like the Sabbath, was not something that originated in the ancient Israelite legal or even religious system?

In the biblical narrative, we learn that three times each year—Passover, Pentecost, and Feast of Tabernacles (Exod. 23:14–17)—God’s people were to travel to Jerusalem to bring their tithes and offerings personally and to praise and to worship God. Then the Levites distributed the tithe to their brethren all over the land of Israel (see 2 Chron. 31:11–21, Neh. 12:44–47, Neh. 13:8–14). In harmony with this biblical central storehouse principle, the Seventh-day Adventist Church has designated the local conferences, missions, and unions of churches as storehouses on behalf of the world church and from which the ministry is paid.<br><br>For the convenience of church members, tithes and offerings are brought to the local church as part of the worship experience, though some use online giving. The local treasurers then forward the tithe to the conference storehouse. This system of tithe management, outlined and ordained by God, has enabled the Seventh-day Adventist Church to have a worldwide and growing impact in the world.<br><br><strong>Imagine if everyone decided to give their tithe to whomever they wanted to, at the expense of the Adventist Church itself. What would happen to our church? Why is that practice, then, such a bad idea and contrary to Scripture?</strong><br></p>",

What does God propose to do with the tithe?</strong><br><br><strong>Leviticus 27:30</strong><br><br><sup>30</sup>&nbsp;And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord’s. It is holy to the Lord.<br><br><strong>Numbers 18:21, 24</strong><br><br><sup>21</sup>&nbsp;“Behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tithes in Israel as [a]an inheritance in return for the work which they perform, the work of the tabernacle of meeting.<br><br><sup>24</sup>&nbsp;For the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer up as a heave offering to the Lord, I have given to the Levites [a]as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, ‘Among the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.’ ”<br><br>Because God is the owner of everything (Ps. 24:1), He obviously doesn’t need the money. But because the tithe is His, He tells us what to do with it, and that is to use His tithe for the support of the gospel ministry. And, therefore, the needs of the ministers are taken care of with God’s tithe.<br><br>The tribe of Levi—the ministerial force in the Old Testament—was not given large properties, as were the rest of the tribes. Levi was given certain cities, including the cities of refuge, with enough land around them for personal gardens. They were supported by the tithes of the others, and they themselves also tithed their income.<br><br><strong>Read Acts 20:35. What’s the message here, and how does this relate to the question of tithe?</strong><br><br><strong>Acts 20:35</strong><br><br><sup>35</sup>&nbsp;I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”<br><br>Tithing is important because it helps us establish a relationship of trust with God. To take one-tenth of your income and “give it away” (though, technically, it belongs to God anyway) truly is an act of faith, and only by exercising it will your faith grow.<br><br>Think, for instance, about the end times, too, when those who are faithful cannot buy or sell, as depicted in Revelation 13, 14 (see lesson 11). To have developed a trust in God and in His providences and power and love will be of paramount importance when it seems as if all the world is against us. Faithful tithing can surely help develop that trust. Even before then, how crucial for all of us to have learned to trust God, regardless of our situation.<br><br>A second big reason for financial faithfulness is to access the promised tangible blessings of God. As part of the tithing contract, God has promised blessings that are so large that we won’t have room enough to receive them. With our surplus, we can help others and help to support the work of God with our offerings.<br><br><strong>In what ways have you experienced the great truth that it is, indeed, “more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35)?</strong><br></p>",

In many countries, the government takes out taxes from the worker’s pay to cover the cost of services done for the people, such as security, roads and bridges, unemployment benefits, and so on. The question of gross or net primarily involves whether we return tithe on our income before or after such taxes are taken out. Those who are selfemployed can legitimately deduct the cost of doing business in order to determine their actual profit before their personal taxes are deducted.<br><br>Studies of membership’s giving habits reveal that the majority of Seventh-day Adventists tithe on the gross income; that is, before taxes are taken out. In fact, according to the Tithing Principles and Guidelines, published by the General Conference in 1990, “Tithe should be computed on the gross amount of a wage or salary earner's income before legally required or other employee authorized deductions. This includes federal and state income taxes which provide for services and other benefits of responsible citizenship.

Managing for God is a unique privilege—and a responsibility, as well. He blesses and sustains us and asks for only a tenth, and then He uses His tithe to provide for those in the ministry, as He did for the tribe of Levi during the time of ancient Israel.<br><strong><br>Some argue that they don’t like how their tithe money is used and, hence, either don’t tithe or send their money somewhere else. Yet, where did God say, “Bring the tithe to the storehouse, but only if you are sure that the storehouse is using it right”?</strong><br></p>",
