          "lessonText": "<p>Then the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every intent of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually” (Gen. 6:5, NKJV). The verb “saw” (Gen. 6:5) brings the reader back to each step of God’s initial Creation. But what God sees now, instead of tov, “good,” is ra‘, “evil” (Gen. 6:5). It is as if God regretted that He had created the world, now full of ra‘ (Gen. 6:6, 7).\n</p><p>And yet, God’s regret contains elements of salvation, as well. The Hebrew word for “sorry” (nakham) is echoed in the name of Noah (Noakh), which means “comfort” (Gen. 5:29). Thus, God’s response to this wickedness has two sides. It contains the threat of justice, leading to destruction for some; and yet, His response promises comfort and mercy, leading to salvation, as well, for others.\n</p><p>This “double voice” already was heard with Cain and Abel/Seth, and it was repeated through the contrast between the two lines of Seth (the “sons of God”) and Cain (the “sons of men”). Now we hear it again as God differentiates between Noah and the rest of humankind.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

You shall make it with lower, second, and third decks.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>17 </strong></sup>And behold, I Myself am bringing floodwaters on the earth, to destroy from under heaven all flesh in which is the breath of life; everything that is on the earth shall die.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>18</strong></sup> But I will establish My covenant with you; and you shall go into the ark—you, your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And of every living thing of all flesh you shall bring two of every sort into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>20 </strong></sup>Of the birds after their kind, of animals after their kind, and of every creeping thing of the earth after its kind, two of every kind will come to you to keep them alive.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>21 </strong></sup>And you shall take for yourself of all food that is eaten, and you shall gather it to yourself; and it shall be food for you and for them.”</p><p><sup><strong>22 </strong></sup>Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.</p><h3><strong>7</strong><sup><br></sup></h3><p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the Lord said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>2 </strong></sup>You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his female; two each of animals that are unclean, a male and his female;&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>3</strong></sup> also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of all the earth.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>4 </strong></sup>For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy from the face of the earth all living things that I have made.”&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>5 </strong></sup>And Noah did according to all that the Lord commanded him.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.</p><p><sup><strong>7</strong></sup> So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>8</strong></sup> Of clean animals, of animals that are unclean, of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth,&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>9 </strong></sup>two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth.</p><p><br></p><p>Like Daniel, Noah is a prophet who predicts the end of the world. The Hebrew word for the “ark” (tevah) (Gen. 6:14) is the same rare Egyptian loanword that was used for the “ark,” in which the infant Moses was hidden, who was preserved in order to save Israel from Egypt (Exod. 2:3).\n</p><p>Also, some have seen in the general structure of the ark parallels to the ark of the tabernacle (Exod. 25:10). Just as the ark of the Flood will permit the survival of humankind, so the ark of the covenant, a sign of God’s presence in the midst of His people (Exod. 25:22), points to God’s work of salvation for His people.\n</p><p>The phrase “Noah did; according to all that God commanded” (Gen. 6:22, NKJV) concludes the preparatory section. The verb ‘asah, “did,” referring to Noah’s action, responds to the verb ‘asah, “make,” in God’s command, which began the section (Gen. 6:14) and is repeated five times (Gen. 6:14–16). This echo between God’s command and Noah’s response suggests Noah’s absolute obedience to what God had told him to do, to ‘asah. It is interesting that this phrase also is used in the context of the building of the ark of the covenant (Exod. 39:32, 42; Exod. 40:16).\n</p><p>“God gave Noah the exact dimensions of the ark and explicit directions in regard to its construction in every particular. Human wisdom could not have devised a structure of so great strength and durability. God was the designer, and Noah the master builder.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 92.\n</p><p>Again, the parallel between the two “arks” reaffirms their common redemptive function. Noah’s obedience is thus described as a part of God’s plan of salvation. Noah was saved simply because he had that faith to do what God commanded him to do (see Heb. 11:7). He was an early example of a faith that manifests itself in obedience, the only kind of faith that matters (James 2:20).\n</p><p>In short, though Noah “found grace in the eyes of the Lord” (Gen. 6:8), it was in response to this grace, already given him, that Noah acted faithfully and obediently to God’s commands. Isn’t that how it should be with all of us?\n</p><p><strong>Read 2  Peter 2:5–9. Why was only Noah’s family saved?

What we can take from this link is that the Flood is not just about God punishing humanity, but about God saving us, as well.\n</p><p><strong>Read Genesis 7. Why does the description of the Flood remind us of the Creation account? What lessons can we learn from the parallels between the two events?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Genesis 7</strong></p><p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Then the Lord said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you are righteous before Me in this generation.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> You shall take with you seven each of every clean animal, a male and his female; two each of animals that are unclean, a male and his female;&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>3 </strong></sup>also seven each of birds of the air, male and female, to keep the species alive on the face of all the earth.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>4</strong></sup> For after seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth forty days and forty nights, and I will destroy from the face of the earth all living things that I have made.”&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>5 </strong></sup>And Noah did according to all that the Lord commanded him.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>6</strong></sup> Noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters were on the earth.</p><p><sup><strong>7 </strong></sup>So Noah, with his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives, went into the ark because of the waters of the flood.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>8 </strong></sup>Of clean animals, of animals that are unclean, of birds, and of everything that creeps on the earth,&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>9</strong></sup> two by two they went into the ark to Noah, male and female, as God had commanded Noah.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>10</strong></sup> And it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were on the earth.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>11</strong></sup> In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>12</strong></sup> And the rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.</p><p><sup><strong>13</strong></sup> On the very same day Noah and Noah’s sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark—&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>14</strong></sup> they and every beast after its kind, all cattle after their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird of every sort.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>15</strong></sup> And they went into the ark to Noah, two by two, of all flesh in which is the breath of life.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>16</strong></sup> So those that entered, male and female of all flesh, went in as God had commanded him; and the Lord shut him in.\n</p><p>\n</p><p><sup><strong>17</strong></sup> Now the flood was on the earth forty days. The waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it rose high above the earth.&nbsp;<sup><br></sup></p><p><sup><strong>18</strong></sup> The waters prevailed and greatly increased on the earth, and the ark moved about on the surface of the waters.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>19</strong></sup> And the waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth, and all the high hills under the whole heaven were covered.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>20</strong></sup> The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the mountains were covered.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>21</strong></sup> And all flesh died that moved on the earth: birds and cattle and beasts and every creeping thing that creeps on the earth, and every man.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>22</strong></sup> All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, all that was on the dry land, died.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>23</strong></sup> So He destroyed all living things which were on the face of the ground: both man and cattle, creeping thing and bird of the air. They were destroyed from the earth. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>24</strong></sup> And the waters prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days.</p><p><br></p><p>An attentive reading of the text covering the Flood reveals the use of many common words and expressions within the Creation story: “seven” (Gen. 7:2, 3, 4, 10; compare with Gen. 2:1–3); “male and female” (Gen. 7:2, 3, 9, 16; compare with Gen. 1:27); “after its kind” (Gen. 7:14, NKJV; compare with Gen. 1:11, 12, 21, 24, 25); “beasts,” “birds,” “creeping things” (see Gen. 7:8, 14, 21, 23; compare with Gen. 1:24, 25); and “breath of life” (Gen. 7:15, 22; compare with Gen. 2:7).\n</p><p>The Flood story reads, then, somewhat like the Creation story. These echoes of the Creation accounts help reveal that the God who creates is the same as the God who destroys (Deut. 32:39). But these echoes also convey a message of hope: the Flood is designed to be a new creation, out of the waters, which leads to a new existence.\n</p><p>The movement of waters shows that this event of creation is, in fact, reversing the act of Creation in Genesis 1. In contrast to Genesis 1, which describes a separation of the waters above from the waters below (Gen. 1:7), the Flood involves their reunification as they explode beyond their borders (Gen. 7:11).\n</p><p>This process conveys a paradoxical message: God has to destroy what is before in order to allow for a new creation afterward. The creation of the new earth requires the destruction of the old one. The event of the Flood prefigures the future salvation of the world at the end of time: “ ‘I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away’ ” (Rev. 21:1, NKJV; compare with Isa. 65:17).\n</p><p><strong>What in us needs to be destroyed in order to be created anew? (See Rom. 6:1–6.)</strong></p><p><strong>Rom. 6:1–6</strong></p><p><strong><sup>1</sup></strong> What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound?&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> Certainly not! How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>3</strong></sup> Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.\n</p><p><sup><strong>5</strong></sup> For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection,&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>6</strong></sup> knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

          "lessonText": "<p>Genesis 7:22–24 describes the overwhelming and comprehensive effect of the waters, which “destroyed all living things” (Gen. 7:23, NKJV) and “prevailed on the earth one hundred and fifty days” (Gen. 7:24, NKJV). It is against this background of total annihilation and hopelessness that “God remembered” (Gen. 8:1). This phrase is situated in the center of the texts covering the Flood, an indication that this idea is the central message of the Flood story.\n</p><p><strong>Read Genesis 8:1. What does it mean that God “remembered” Noah?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Genesis 8:1</strong></p><p><sup><strong>1 </strong></sup>Then God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the animals that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</p><p><br></p><p>The verb zakhar, “remember,” means that God had not forgotten; it is more than just a mental exercise. In the biblical context, the “God who remembers” means the fulfillment of His promise and often refers to salvation (see Gen. 19:29). In the context of the Flood, “God remembered” means that the waters “stopped” (Gen. 8:2) and that Noah will soon be able to leave the ark (Gen. 8:16).\n</p><p>Though no direct command is yet given to leave, Noah takes the initiative and sends first a raven, and then a dove, to test the situation. Finally, when the dove does not come back, he understands “that the waters were dried up from the earth; and Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked” (Gen. 8:13, NKJV).\n</p><p>Noah’s behavior is rich in practical lessons. On one hand, it teaches us to trust God even though He does not yet directly speak; on the other hand, faith does not deny the value of thinking and testing. Faith does not exclude the duty to think, to seek, and to see if what we learned is true.\n</p><p>And yet, Noah goes out only when God, finally, tells him to do so (Gen. 8:15–19). That is, even when he knows it’s safe to leave, Noah still relies on God and waits for God’s signal before going out of the ark. He waited patiently within the ark. “As he had entered at God’s command, he waited for special directions to depart. .  .  . At last an angel descended from heaven, opened the massive door, and bade the patriarch and his household go forth upon the earth and take with them every living thing.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, p. 105.\n</p><p><strong>Read Genesis 8:1, Genesis 19:29, and Psalm 106:4. What does the expression “God remembers” mean? What does this truth mean for us, now—that is, how has God shown you that He “remembers” you?</strong></p><p><strong>Genesis 19:29</strong></p><p><sup><strong>29</strong></sup> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when He overthrew the cities in which Lot had dwelt.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Psalm 106:4</strong></p><p><sup><strong>4</strong></sup> Remember me, O Lord, with the favor You have toward Your people.&nbsp;Oh, visit me with Your salvation,</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

In contrast to the divine threat to destroy (Gen. 6:17), this covenant was the promise of life.\n</p><p><strong>Read Genesis 8:20. What did Noah do first when he went out of the ark, and why?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Genesis 8:20</strong></p><p><sup><strong>20</strong></sup> Then Noah built an altar to the Lord, and took of every clean animal and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</p><p><br></p><p>Like Adam and Eve, who surely worshiped God on Sabbath immediately after the six days of Creation, Noah worshiped God immediately after the Flood, another creation event in and of itself. There is a difference, however, between the two acts of worship. Unlike Adam and Eve, who worshiped the Lord directly, Noah had to resort to a sacrifice. This is the first mention in the Scriptures of an altar. The sacrifice is a “burnt offering” (‘olah), the oldest and most frequent sacrifice. For Noah, this sacrifice was a thanksgiving offering (compare with Num. 15:1–11), given in order to express his gratefulness to the Creator, who had saved him.\n</p><p><strong>Read Genesis 9:2–4. How did the Flood affect the human diet? What is the principle behind God’s restrictions?\n</strong></p><p><strong>Genesis 9:2–4</strong></p><p><sup><strong>2</strong></sup> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. They are given into your hand.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>3 </strong></sup>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. I have given you all things, even as the green herbs.&nbsp;</p><p><sup><strong>4</strong></sup> But you shall not eat flesh with its life, that is, its blood.</p><p>Because of the effect of the Flood, plant food was no longer available as it used to be. Therefore, God allowed humans to eat animal flesh. This change of diet generated a change in the relationship between humans and animals, in contrast to what had been between them in the original creation. In the Creation account, humans and animals shared the same plant diet and did not threaten each other. In the post-Flood world, the killing of animals for food entailed a relationship of fear and dread (Gen. 9:2). Once they started eating each other, humans and animals, no doubt, developed a relationship quite different from what they had enjoyed in Eden.\n</p><p>God’s tolerance, however, had two restrictions. First, not all the animals were proper for food. The first restriction was implicit in the distinction between “clean and unclean” animals, which was a part of the Creation order (see Gen. 8:19, 20; compare with Gen. 1:21, 24). The second one, which was explicit and new, was to abstain from the consumption of blood, for life is in the blood (Gen. 9:4).</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

In short, God has not given up on His creation.\n</p><p>In fact, the following text, which talks about God’s blessing, takes us back to the original Creation, with its blessing (Gen. 1:22, 28; Gen. 2:3).

Following the preceding section, which parallels the sixth day of the Creation account, this section parallels the section covering the seventh day of the Creation account, the Sabbath. Inside the text, the repetition, seven times, of the word “covenant” resonates with the Sabbath. Like the Sabbath, the rainbow is the sign of the covenant (Gen. 9:13, 14, 16; compare with Exod. 31:12–17). Also, like the Sabbath, the rainbow has a universal scope; it applies to the whole world. Just as the Sabbath, as a sign of Creation, is for everyone, everywhere, the promise that no other worldwide flood will come is for everyone, everywhere, as well.\n</p><p><strong>Next time you see a rainbow, think about all of God’s promises to us. Why can we trust those promises, and how does the rainbow show us that we can trust them?</strong></p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",

To be sure, human wickedness is not a new phenomenon. Look at the parallels between their time and ours.\n</p><p>“The sins that called for vengeance upon the antediluvian world exist today. The fear of God is banished from the hearts of men, and His law is treated with indifference and contempt. The intense worldliness of that generation is equaled by that of the generation now living. . . . God did not condemn the antediluvians for eating and drinking. . . . Their sin consisted in taking these gifts without gratitude to the Giver, and debasing themselves by indulging appetite without restraint. It was lawful for them to marry. Marriage was in God’s order; it was one of the first institutions which He established. He gave special directions concerning this ordinance, clothing it with sanctity and beauty; but these directions were forgotten, and marriage was perverted and made to minister to passion. A similar condition of things exists now. That which is lawful in itself is carried to excess. . . . Fraud and bribery and theft stalk unrebuked in high places and in low. The issues of the press teem with records of murder. . . . The spirit of anarchy is permeating all nations, and the outbreaks that from time to time excite the horror of the world are but indications of the pent-up fires of passion and lawlessness that, having once escaped control, will fill the earth with woe and desolation. The picture which Inspiration has given of the antediluvian world represents too truly the condition to which modern society is fast hastening. Even now, in the present century, and in professedly Christian lands, there are crimes daily perpetrated as black and terrible as those for which the old-world sinners were destroyed.”—Ellen G. White, Patriarchs and Prophets, pp. 101, 102.\n</p><p><strong>Discussion Questions:\n</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> What are the common characteristics of the pre-Flood society and ours? What do these common characteristics teach us about God’s grace, that, despite all this, He loves the world and is, still, seeking to save whom He can?\n</p><p><strong>2</strong>. Some people argue that Noah’s flood was only a local event. What is wrong with that idea? If this were true, why would every local flood (and every rainbow) make God a liar?</p><p><br></p><p><strong>INSIDE STORY</strong></p><p><strong>Faithful Grandparents</strong></p><p><strong><em>By Andrew McChesney\n</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>In the evening, after it was too dark to work in the maize field, the Reyneke family gathered around a large kitchen table for supper in their small farmhouse in central South Africa. Father, Mother, and their seven boys and four girls ate homegrown food every evening: maize porridge along with potatoes, pumpkin, and meat. Afterward, the children cleared away the dishes, and Father opened his Dutch Bible for family worship.\n</p><p>On this particular evening, Father opened the Bible to Exodus 20 and read, “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it you shall do no work” (Exodus 20:8–10, NKJV).\n</p><p>“Listen,” Father said, puzzled. “It says here, ‘Six days you shall labor, but on the seventh day you shall rest.’ ” The idea of resting on the seventh day was new to him. He and the family had always observed the first day, Sunday, as the Sabbath, but the Bible said otherwise.\n</p><p>Father made a note in the margin of his Bible. Beside the words “Six days you shall labor” he wrote, “Plow time.” Beside the words “On the seventh day you shall rest” he wrote, “Rest time.” The matter was clear to him. His family started keeping the seventh-day Sabbath. Families took notice on the neighboring farms, and soon three of them also were keeping the Sabbath. Time passed, and a Seventh-day Adventist literature evangelist stopped by the farm and sold Father a little Dutch-language book titled God’s Covenant With Man.\n</p><p>Through the book, Father and Mother learned about the Seventh-day Adventist Church for the first time. They understood that other people also worshiped on the seventh-day Sabbath.\n</p><p>While there is no historical record of Father and Mother joining the Seventh-day Adventist Church, four of their 11 children became Adventists. One of their grandsons is Gideon Reyneke, a pastor who helps oversee mission work in South Africa and 14 other countries as executive secretary of the Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division.\n</p><p>Gideon said he owes his Adventist heritage to faithful grandparents who simply read the Bible and obeyed it in the 1920s. “We pray that by telling this story from generation to generation, it will yield results and bring many more people to Jesus Christ,” he said.\n</p><p>This quarter’s Thirteenth Sabbath Offering will help spread the gospel in Gideon Reyneke’s home Southern Africa-Indian Ocean Division. Thank you for planning a generous offering.</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p>",
